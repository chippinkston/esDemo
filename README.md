# ElasticSearch Tutorial

This is a Quick and dirty intro to using ElasticSearch.

## Prerequisites

* Unix(y) terminal
* Docker
* curl / Postman
* git

## Assumptions

This guide will use the Postman desktop app for most of it's instruction.  Mainly because GUI's are easier to use.  In follow ups, I may try to match actions to `curl` commands, but this is just a quick intro.  This intro is also based on a OS X (mac) GUI, so things may be slightly different, but should be close.

## Instructions
Start at chapter 1.  Each chapter builds from there.
